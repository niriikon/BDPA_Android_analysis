#### Project plan
Filter Android dataset to only include meaningful columns and try to create a machine learning model for detecting malware.

#### What we seek from the data
We need to do research of what typically is used to detect malware when analyzing traffic.
Refer to the research and try using those methods for filtering our data set.

#### Project phases
* Find related research articles
* Choose data filtration referring to the articles
* Choose model for analyzing the data
* Training and testing the model
* Report results

#### Action points
* Getting started: Find out some examples how to use this kind of data for this project.
* Communicate with team so we can make progress.
